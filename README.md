# Python for Finance
### Libraries
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib
* BeautifulSoup

I am working through the tutorials here to use Python to analyze Stocks:  
[Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/stock-data-manipulation-python-programming-for-finance/)

`p##.py` corresponds to the tutorial numbers.

`*.csv` is an output file which stores stock data after downloading.

`testmutfund.py` is my file to test accessing individual stocks, specifically mutual funds.

Pandas_Datareader is used to access Stock prices.
[The documentation](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_data.html)
is very concise and helpful.
