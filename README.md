Using these tutorials here to use Python to analyze Stocks:  
[Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/stock-data-manipulation-python-programming-for-finance/)

`p##.py` corresponds to the tutorials

`*.csv` is an output file which stores stock data

`testmutfund.py` is my file to test accessing individual stocks

Pandas_Datareader [documentation](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_data.html)
is helpful.

Pandas_Datareader has a yahoo function which allows you to get a simple Open-High-Low-Close-Volume-AdjClose for a stock but, I want Market Cap.

Then I can show how sectors change over time as their value changes

We will have to play with the psuedo-Yahoo Finance API...
