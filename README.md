# PYFi
I am using Python and the Pandas library to learn how to analyze Stocks 

I am working through the tutorials  here:  
[Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/stock-data-manipulation-python-programming-for-finance/)

This is a repository to store the code and files I will be using.
