# PYFi
I am using Python and the Pandas library to learn how to analyze Stocks 

I am working through the Python Finance Tutorials available here:  
[Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/stock-data-manipulation-python-programming-for-finance/)

This is the code I am writing for the Project.
